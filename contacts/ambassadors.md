# SciPyLA Ambassadors

The SciPy Latin America community consists of a diverse and distributed
group of professionals and amateurs of scientific research with the common
goal in mind of fostering the adoption of state-of-the-art tools powered
by the Python programming language. Ambassadors role was created in 2016
in order to cope with the organization of SciPyLA 2016 conference and with the
natural outgrowth of the community throughout the Latin American region
beyond the frontiers of the founding members' home country, Argentina,
and the conference host, Brazil.

## What defines a SciPyLA Ambassador ?

A SciPyLA Ambassador is passionate of the Python programming language and
its applications in scientific research. As such she/he represents the
local SciPyLA community of a Latin American country and is the main
point of contact between the SciPyLA conference Organization Team (OrgaTeam) and the
corresponding national communities, corporations, organizations,
societies and governmental institutions.

Prior to the SciPyLA conference Ambassadors are responsible for
distributing conference announcements and news through the channels
available in their home countries. They will assist the conference
OrgaTeam with discovering and reaching prospective attendees
as well as assisting them to deal with paper
submission guidelines. They will also contact on behalf of the
conference OrgaTeam the institutions, societies and stakeholders
interested in proposing remarkable members of the country's 
scientific and Python communities to assume the role of reviewers.
Since it is quite complex to be an expert on all scientific disciplines,
for Ambassadors work to be efficient they should be able to
summon and/or ask for advice to a group of experts in the different
fields of science e.g. bioinformatics, natural sciences (e.g. physics,
chemistry), engineering (e.g. electrical engineering, mechanical engineering,
informatics), economics, management science, earth sciences, social sciences,
and humanities.

The organization of the SciPyLA conference should evolve to become
more distributed, efficient and collaborative. Ambassadors are key to
fulfill these goals since they are reponsible for executing the tasks
covered by the budget assigned to each country by the SciPyLA OrgaTeam.
They are the ones who negotiate with the OrgaTeam the terms for executing
local initiatives aimed at promoting the SciPyLA conference in their home
countries. Ambassadors are granted with the permission to contact
on behalf of the OrgaTeam the enterprises, organizations, and
stakeholders operating in their home countries so as to negotiate
the terms for them to be considered as sponsors as a result of
delivering directly to the Ambassador's compatriot the financial aids
(e.g. flight tickets, hotel reservations) they are in need of. 
Ambassadors may complement the press strategies of the OrgaTeam by
recording interviews with keynote speakers, authors of relevant research,
sponsors, functionaries of organizations to the promotion of science, etc.

During the SciPyLA conference Ambassadors are part of the
OrgaTeam. Because of this they will rank higher when applying for
financial support, should they need it. They will wear an organizers
badge which will grant them with access to all scheduled activities.
Ambassadors will talk to the rest of the OrgaTeam on behalf of
all their countrymen attending the event. At the end of the event
Ambassadors may attend the SciPyLA Community Summit, thus
participating in the strategic decisions about the future of the
SciPyLA community. In that context they may present their
candidature to opt in for hosting the next conference.
